## Synopsis
A Go type system and demo AI player for [sirpent-rust](https://github.com/sirpent-team/sirpent-rust), a multiplayer snake server.

## Installation

<!--
These need testing before advertising them:

Sirpent can use any of the [Regular Tilings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_tilings_by_convex_regular_polygons#Regular_Tilings) for its Grid. Rust's type system is a little too limited to choose at runctime, so it's a compile-time option.

``` sh
cargo run --no-default-features --features square
```

``` sh
cargo run --no-default-features --features triangle
```
